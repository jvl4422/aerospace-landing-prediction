Getting data for this is an absolute pain, so I will focus on the longer haul flights and destinations and the subsequent
fleet of planes that are suitable to operate those routes. I will also abstract and say that every flight operates every
day because it is quite tedious as airlines don't really publish which days they fly. I am also going to be using an
abstracted suitability metric, because right now that makes sense.

100 is the value if that plane is "optimal" for that destination, meaning KLM has advertised that this aircraft flies this route
75 if the plane actively flies this route, but it is not an advertised destination by KLM
50 if the plane is "ok" for that destination, meaning it can operate the route because other planes of that type do, but it
has not operated that route itself.
0 if the plane is "unsuitable" for that destination (meaning it is not able to fly to that destination)
This will not explicitly be represented in any of the tables but it will be applied as a value if none of the aircraft
have serviced that destination (at least on the week long record and advertised destination lists)

Challenges: Curating the dataset myself is VERY tedious. No existing dataset of what I am trying to replicate for any airline
The publicly available data also only goes back one week so is not really representative of a year round model.
Otherwise, my model will be impossible to solve when the number of destinations does not exactly match the number of planes.
Additionally, there is no error checking, I think if an invalid destination is entered it will just break.
I also do not think it is possible to have duplicate destinations.

LASTLY: I would like to further compartmentalize this code. I think formatting the data and passing it to the model
be two different functions. I will make this change after the draft submission bc everything works now.
