# Aerospace Landing & Prediction
CISC 352 Course Project

Welcome to our course project! To get our code up and running you will need to install Python, Pandas, Google's OR Tools and the Meteostat API. You will likely want to use https://editor.planning.domains/# to run the planning portion of the project

We recommend you make a new Python environment for this project to avoid any potential library clashes.
If you made a new conda env, make sure to navigate to that env and activate it in terminal
(this can be done through the anaconda interface).
Once your environment has been activated (you'll know because it will have the name
surrounded in parentheses), execute the following in terminal: python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
Then hopefully colouring will show up here which verifies it has been installed correctly.

Meteostat API information can be found here: https://dev.meteostat.net/api/
