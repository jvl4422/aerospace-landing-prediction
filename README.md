# Smart Skies: Machine Learning and Optimization Solutions for Modern Aviation Challenges
## Abstract
The aviation industry serves as a critical component of global commerce, facilitating economic growth, tourism, and emergency response efforts. However, it faces escalating challenges, including airport congestion and heightened post-pandemic travel demands. In this paper, we address three key issues within aviation through the application of techniques in artificial intelligence. Firstly, we will tackle the complex task of assigning airplanes to routes, considering factors such as range requirements and past flight data. Secondly, we propose methods to optimize landing lineups, crucial for enhancing airport efficiency, particularly in congested airports such as London Heathrow. Finally, we delve into Bayesian inference techniques to analyze the probabilities of flight delays, providing insights for proactive mitigation strategies. Further exploration of these solutions introduces interesting solutions to the evolving challenges facing the aviation industry.

## Installation Instructions
Welcome to our course project! To get our code up and running, you must install Python, Pandas, Google's OR Tools and the Meteostat API. You will likely want to use https://editor.planning.domains/# to run the planning portion of the project. Our code has been written to be compatible with the planner: Temporal Fast Downward. We will also assume that you have already installed Python and Pandas

We recommend you make a new Python environment for this project to avoid any potential library clashes.
If you made a new conda env, make sure to navigate to that env and ensure it is activated before completing any of the commands.

Execute the following in terminal to install Google's OR Tools: 

`python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools`

Meteostat API information & installation instructions can be found here: https://dev.meteostat.net/api/
