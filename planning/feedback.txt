When running the problem through the planning.domains, OPTIC says the problem is unsolvable but then prints out a solution. 
Should we be concerned about this? Or is it ok if we can get another planner to solve it (Temporal Fast Downward)

I am also working with a modified time version because temporal fast downward does not like actions with duration of 0.
So, approving a plane to land takes one time unit, and every other action takes actual time + 1.
