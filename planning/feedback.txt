When running the problem through the planning.domains, OPTIC says the problem is unsolvable but then prints out a solution. 
Should we be concerned about this? Or is it ok if we can get another planner to solve it (Temporal Fast Downward)

I am also working with a modified time version because temporal fast downward does not like actions with duration of 0.
So, approving a plane to land takes one time unit, and every other action takes actual time + 1. This means that there
are some weird time calculations being made within the problem statement. 

I tried to add a waiting action which would allow a schedule that is not fully packed (back to back)
but it fails, I will leave in the waiting action. Do you happen to have any tips on how to solve this Or
whether it is possible to have such an action? 

(:durative-action wait
    :parameters (
      ?pln - airplane
    )
    :duration (= ?duration 1)
    :condition (
      and (not (canland ?pln))
    )
    :effect (and 
        (at end (increase(total-time) 1))
    )
)

Link I got my data from : http://www.lhr-lgw.co.uk/lhr-movements/2024-02-lhr/mlhr010224.txt

The rwy variable is also arbitrary right now because we are only dealing with optimizing one runway. 

Is there a way to make the domain less verbose? A lot of the actions and durations apply to multiple objects

I also have yet to implement the super class, since only one plane corresponds to it (Airbus A380)

LIMITATIONS: This currently cannot handle a scenario where the schedule is not full.
